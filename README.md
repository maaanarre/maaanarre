## 🧠 Who am I ?

I’m an **AI Engineering student** fascinated by how intelligence can emerge from  
*math, data, and carefully written code*.

I don’t just enjoy making models work —  
I enjoy understanding **why** they work, **when** they fail, and **what that says about intelligence itself**.

Being part of a new generation entering AI means:
- learning fast,
- building from scratch,
- and questioning things that already “work”.

(And yes, Googling a lot — but with intent.)

## 🔍 What I like to build and explore

I enjoy working on projects that sit between **theory and practice**, including:

- Teaching machines to **see, listen, and make decisions**
- Turning research papers into **reproducible, usable systems**
- Exploring both **classical approaches (GMMs, MFCCs)** and **modern deep learning**
- Designing pipelines that are not only accurate, but **understandable**

I care less about models that only perform well on benchmarks,  
and more about systems that **make sense when you look inside them**.
